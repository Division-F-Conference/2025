    title: "Using robots as proxies to understand human design"
    description: "Robots are more than tools; they can mirror human design. By embedding principles of movement, perception, and interaction into machines, we externalise and test our own assumptions about intelligence, embodiment, and adaptation. This talk will explore how robots can serve as proxies to study how humans are designed—revealing both the constraints and the creative possibilities that shape us. Drawing on examples from soft robotics, embodied intelligence, and human–robot interaction, I will show how robotic systems expose hidden aspects of our own biology and behaviour, from sensorimotor coordination to social communication. By treating robots as experimental models, much like biologists use organisms, we generate new insights into the dynamics of human design."

    title: "Competitive interactions shape brain dynamics and computation across species"
    description: "Adaptive cognition relies on cooperation across anatomically distributed brain circuits. However, specialised neural systems are also in constant competition for limited processing resources. How does the brain’s network architecture enable it to balance these cooperative and competitive tendencies? Here we use computational whole-brain modelling to integrate multimodal structural and functional data, and examine the dynamical and computational relevance of cooperative and competitive interactions in the mammalian connectome. Across human, macaque, and mouse we show that the architecture of the models that most faithfully reproduce brain activity, consistently combines modular cooperative interactions with diffuse, long-range competitive interactions."

    title: "Addressing Climate Change"
    description: "The pinnacle of international efforts on climate change, the Paris Agreement, is highly unlikely to succeed. But what would a credible solution have to look like? This talk has two parts; first I'll argue that an appropriate framing of the problem is in terms of managing a shared resource: cooperating over the atmosphere. Secondly, I'll present a concrete proposal for how this could be implemented in practice: the Themis Mechanism."
